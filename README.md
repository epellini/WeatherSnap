# **WeatherSnap**
Welcome to the Simple Weather App! This web application allows you to easily check the current weather for any city around the world. It's a straightforward and user-friendly tool that provides you with real-time weather information. Made using HTML5, CSS & JavaScript.

## Features
**City based weather:** Simply enter the name of any city, and the app will fetch and display the current weather conditions for that location.

**Open Weather API:** The app uses [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to provide you with accurate and up-to-date weather data.

**Clean design**: I've designed this app with simplicity and ease of use in mind. The clean interface allows you to quickly get the information you need without any hassle.

## Why this project?
WeatherSnap is a personal project that allowed me to practice and improve my CSS and JavaScript skills. I felt inspired by online courses I took from [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) that taught me how to create web interfaces and implement APIs.
